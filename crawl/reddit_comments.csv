"Hi all, going to Vietnam this year with three friends and we‚Äôve booked an overnight train from Nha Trang to Da Nang in a first class soft sleeper car. I‚Äôm already aware that it might be loud, and that there could be bugs in the room, but I‚Äôd love to know any tips from previous travelers on what to do - or not to do.

"Hey, 

I'm going to Vietnam in the beginning of June. I know that June is not the best month to visit Vietnam due to the raining season. I'm planning to stay 2/3 days in Hanoi but I really want to explore the countryside. I came across some potential destinations like Ha Long Bay, Ninh binh, Sa Pa, Ha Giang, Mai Chau or the Ba Be Nation Park.

"For context was getting a sleeper bus to Ha Giang and stupidly fell asleep with phone in hand and it got robbed by a random viet dude. Bus driver had CCTV and said he‚Äôd have a better look for it.

So for my 3 days on the Ha Giang Loop I had a film camera and that was itüòÇ was stressing out tryna access flight details to get out of the country, bank acc etc.

Get back to Jasmine hostels and he had known the dude who robbed the phone and tracked him down and got the phone back. He even recorded the whole thing (wish I‚Äôd got him to send it on) üòÇüòÇ crisis averted and I sorted him with a couple of quid for his troubles.

Anyone had anything happen like that in Vietnam or elsewhere is SEA? ",2,2,0,2,2,2.8465214191666663,691,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"US involvement in Vietnam was way before my time, but today I was reading [a blog post](https://lde421.blogspot.com/2012/12/chuck-neils-vietnam-dreaming-of-white.html) about it that I followed from r/askhistorians, and it reminded me of what the US government did in Iraq and Afghanistan as I was growing up in the 90's. Back then I was disgusted by the way US media would slander people of these regions to justify the war, and used to read blogs written by kids based in Asia to better know them and what their lives were like.  

Ironically, it was easier for me to find these things back when Yahoo was the primary search engine and google didn't exist yet, because people submitted their own sites to the appropriate categories and we weren't just subject to the whims of algorithms.  

I'm curious to know whether anything like this still exists online. In the US it's difficult to get news about the larger world and we don't get much coverage outside of major catastrophic events.  I'm interested to know what's going on from the perspective of the average person, how they feel about relations with America, and what life is like these days.",0,0,0,0,0,2.8621794708333335,1150,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I'll be visiting the beautiful land of the ascending dragon in about a weeks' time and traveling to Ha Giang at the start of June, where I'll commence the Ha Giang Loop ride.

I see a lot of posts here about travellers with little to no riding experience, but no posts about people who have riding experience wanting to utilise a 'bigger' bike (>500cc). I've searched every Google result - all the links are purple now and I've yet to find a motorcycle that fits the bill. Does anyone have any recommendations on a local company?

I was able to find one company with a Royal Enfield Himalayan and BMW R 1300 GS (a bit of an overkill, I know), which is right up my alley. But they're based in Hanoi and delivering the bike up to Ha Giang is US$100 each way, AND they require a IDP 1968 permit (my country only issues the IDP 1949 permit) - so that's another issue that I'm currently facing...

"Please note if my following questions are too loaded or too technical.

Some context: I've taken a recent interest in photogrammetry and would like to scan some Lego bricks I've bought. Since Lego bricks' natural gloss interfere with 3D scanning, I've done research online on materials and where to buy them. However, it seems like most vendors these materials, such as spray-on-mask, are selling to established businesses and companies instead of hobbyists like me. Besides that, there doesn't seem to be an active 3D scanning hobbyist scene from my research.

So I want to ask:

1. Are there any 3D scanning/photogrammetry vendors for hobbyists in Vietnam?
2. If there are, do they have a store in or at least ship to HCMC?
3. If there aren't, then where can I buy washable masking sprays or at least find a substitute material? It must be a material that I could apply and wash off without damage to the scanning subject.
4. Are there any forums or groups of Vietnamese 3D scanning/photogrammetry hobbyists?",0,0,0,0,0,6.8342984016666675,1010,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"So, just wanted to share this wholesome account that happened today. I'm from India and have been travelling Vietnam these days. Today I took a city tour of Hue where there was also an elderly Vietnamese couple in our group. Throughout the ride, they were very nice to me (the grandpa spoke English but the granny didn't, but she was also very smiley). They bought me beer (I hadn't asked) and explained that it was Hue's special beer (like Hanoi beer in Hanoi and Saigon beer in HCMC). They didn't even let me pay for it. Not only that, they kept giving me different food items to try, and were very happy to see that I liked the food. They both were really lovely.

In both Hanoi and Hue, people have been really nice to me, and this particular incident very much makes it clear that Vietnamese hospitality is just amazing.",0,0,0,0,0,9.114893409166667,825,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"The trail was a logistical network of roads that connected the North and South, passing through Laos and Cambodia. While the Vietnamese referred to it as the  *ƒê∆∞·ªùng Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n* ( Annamite Range Trail), it was US that named it as Ho Chi Minh Trail. There was a similiar trail during the First Indo China War set up by the Viet Minh. Rated as one of the greatest feats of military engineering ever, it was built during a time of intense warfare, and acted as a lifeline to the Viet Cong down South.

"Just got back from Vietnam - North to South tour over a couple of weeks around my partner's birthday. Absolutely loved the experience and would love to visit again and slow down the travel to take things in a bit more.

I have some tips for folk from my own experience. I'm from the UK - and specifically Cornwall where tourism is a mainstay of our local economy and I know what it's like to have your land flooded with tourists.

1: the pound is roughly 30000 Vietnamese dong, so divide by 3 and knock off some noughts. It's easier to knock off the last three 0s from the dong price first. Very important for weighing up the personal value of something you might buy/are being hassled to buy.

2: Security at airports is not like our biometric passport scanners in the UK - it's guys in very officious looking uniforms taking their sweet time to weigh up whether you should be let in (or out) of the country. Bear this in mind for planning follow up transport or arriving for a flight. Huge queues. It took about an hour after arriving to get through security, and an hour and a half when departing for our UK flight (important as they were shutting the doors by the time we got through security).

3 phone data - while queuing to get into the country in Ho Chi Minh, we opted to buy some local SIM cards from a stall next to the queues. They were ¬£8 each and gave us unlimited data for our 2 weeks. Ideal. Might be able to get it cheaper but convenience after 20 hours of travelling was worth it. EDIT - thanks to u/phantasizer for pointing out these stalls aren't legit. Our experiences were the sim cards worked fine but see their comment below.

4 airport transfers - take advantage of these where offered. Again, just takes the stress out of things as we found the country quite overwhelming, especially HCMC and Hanoi (overwhelming in a good way though).

5 city markets - we went to Hanoi, Cat Ba, Hoi An, Ph√∫ Quoc and Saigon and in each place there was a sizeable (Cat Ba was smaller) market advertised as a ""must see"" experience but in truth is the same place selling knock off clothes, luggage, souvenirs, food ingredients, etc. Every fourth or fifth stall is EXACTLY the same stuff. It gets boring after 10 minutes. Would advise visiting this wherever you are on your last day to buy some stuff to take home rather than lugging it around.

6 scooters - I wouldn't consider this unless you know how to ride a scooter, especially in the cities. Vietnamese traffic is an organic wonder to beyond from the safety of a taxi.

7 crossing the road - for UK folk, they drive on the other side in Vietnam. Very important to look both ways but believe the hype, pick your moment and go confidently - Vietnamese also have incredible spacial awareness to avoid you.

8 GRAB - download the app, add your card and Grab away. Again, speaking of convenience and least stress, you will quickly appreciate not walking for 20 minutes in +30¬∞ city heat and choosing to take an air conditioned taxi. For comparison, a trip that would cost about a tenner in UK costs a ¬£1. Incredible value for your wallet, comfort and time.

9 food - try everything. OK, maybe Thit Cho on Hanoi is a stretch too far for the average Brit but everything else should be experienced. Personal favourites were Hotpot (so wish we had similar in UK) and BBQ where it's in the middle of the table and you do all the grilling. You can find Pho for equivalent of about ¬£1 if you need shoestring food.

10 wine - some places sell local Dalat wine which is OK but wine is not a big deal in Vietnam and is usually at least UK price if not more. My partner found this hard as she doesn't like beer and didn't want to drink cocktails all holiday. Dalat is perfectly good plonk though - white and red.

11 Hoi An - don't believe the hype. We spent too long here (so sorry Saigon, you weren't as loved as you should have been). It can be done in a day and you've experienced it all. Reviews were lead to believe there was more to it. Nightlife was a laugh in a trashy way though if you want to do the whole Brits abroad thing.

12 Be respectful - my experience was that Vietnamese are a country of grinders who work all hours of the day. So speaking of Brits (or anyone else) abroad be respectful that not everyone you see is there for your photo opp or to help you and those in markets and hospitality are making a living, so don't waste their time. British especially are a nation of window shoppers and I'm not sure that came across too well on our travels. Try to be low key while you weave around the lives of Viet folk.

13 Learn to confidently say ""no thanks"" - politely saying ""no thanks, just looking"" and moving on is a valuable tool for getting through certain touristy areas. Engaging with folk will both give that person the wrong expectations and exhaust you in the process.

14 Google Translate - download this and use for basic enquiries. I don't think I was saying Xin Chao, Cam On or Tam Biet properly, so for anything beyond that, I have no clue. Don't assume people speak English - some are good enough to say Hello first to get past that.

15 Find a spot and just watch - find a coffee shop, relax and watch a very different people go about their lives. Things I enjoyed: how cool all the young people are; how obsessed the young folk are about selfies; care of children; karaoke round the dinner table (understand not to everyone's taste); friends enjoying a hotpot; lads fighting a crab into said hotpot; groups of friends having animated toasts after work; care of old folk; many and varied ways to use a scooter to carry people, goods, materials, flat screen TVs, dogs.

16 Beers in order of my personal taste - Saigon Red; Larue; Saigon Special; Hanoi; 333

17 Beer St in Saigon - go walk through it. I have never seen anything like it. Don't necessarily stop there but go observe it's wild, perverse nature.

18 If staying in a hotel, before you head out for the day, soak a flannel in water, put it in a glass, put the glass in the fridge. You will appreciate it when you get back from your enevitablely roasting walk around town (mad dogs and Englishman..).

19 pack for very hot weather (in May at least). I took a set of clothes for UK - these were worn to and from the airport and otherwise lived at the bottom on my bag. Otherwise, shorts, t-shirts and light shirts to keep the sun off. Even cotton t-shirts felt too much at times. My favourite items were a matched black linen shirt and shorts I bought out there. Pretty much lived out of them exclusively towards the end of the trip. Must have announced my musky presence from a great distance. Utilise the laundry services for sure.

20 ignore the rubbish - try to tune it out and adjust your hygiene expectations. This is important as in two weeks, I got blisters, bites, at anything and yet came away without food poisoning, infection or anything else. It's an eyesore at times to these soft UK eyes but don't let it ruin the trip. Hope Vietnam authorities can do more to handle that as it'll mount up the more the country is discovered. 

Sure there's more but just offloading after getting back. Hope it helps.

EDIT: More to add

21. Cash is king but card is accepted - in the UK, because of COVID, cash has definitely taken a back seat to contactless payment. I've rarely had to use cash other than to pay for things off FB marketplace. Vietnam isn't like that, despite being at least as technologically advanced as the UK in certain respects. Always have some dong on you. Few hundred thousand covers small purchases like water, Bahn Mi for the road, restorative coffee, etc. A lot of places do accept card but can come with a 3% fee. And get ready as they take the card and put it into the machine - it's not a scam (at least, I don't think it is) just how it's done. The card machine is handed to you for pin and then half the time they need a signature on the receipt. Monzo is a good bank for travelling as you get free ATM withdrawals on their side up to ¬£100 and you can instantly see the conversion of the latest transactions.

22. Ice cubes - when I got my travel vaccines, I was told to be wary of ice as much as tap water. From experience, iced coffee from most coffee shops has been fine (thankful in the heat) and cocktails with ice also fine. I'd maybe avoid the street side iced drinks and stick to modern looking bars,  coffee shops and hotels to be on the safe side.

23. Geckos - you may see geckos in hotel rooms and elsewhere. Fear not, they are harmless and like to feast on mosquitos. As with any wild animal though - and includes all the cute looking street dogs - observe from a distance. We shared our cabin in Phu Quoc with a foot long Tokay Gecko which absolutely freaked us out for an evening until the manager told us it's fine and just to leave it be and it'll keep it's distance. Definitely the coolest wild creature I saw.

24. Overnight train to Da Nang - if you want to traverse the length of the country and save some time, get the Night Train to Da Naaaang (cue: Madness). Pay the extra for your own cabin. It's relatively comfortable and the next day you can while away the morning watching the mountains and coast roll by. You get complimentary snacks, drinks and a simple breakfast as well.

25. Cat Ba Express - originally, we planned to make our own way to Cat Ba by taxi>train,>ferry>taxi. At last minute, I scrapped that off of a recommendation on here and went with a company called Cat Ba Express. For ¬£20 each, we got a return - hotel-to-hotel on an air conditioned bus and on the way back took up the option of a cable car over the water from Cat Ba to Haiphong. Well worth it, again for convenience and time.

26. Safety - prompted by u/G_saxboi comment below, while we both felt safe for the majority of the trip, do use common sense when out and about. If you need to get your bearings, find a coffee shop, have a sit down and a drink, and check then - being glued to your phone while walking around isn't the best advice in most touristy parts of the world.

Regarding Beer St in Saigon - you can walk through albeit hassled to come for a drink but enter any of those establishments at your own risk.

Also, generally good advice not to engage with anyone who randomly comes up to you. Just say ""no thanks"" and move on.",15,15,0,15,15,10.389813128333333,10319,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Thanks

My husband and I have lived here for over 5 years but only traveled in the north (please blame covid for a lot of that).

We are taking a short, cheapish  vacation to Da Nang (1 night) and Hoi An (3 nights by the beach) . We both ride automatic motorbikes and have been doing for the past 5 years. Are there any rental places that allow for more than a single day rental? We would really like to be able to explore a bit over our 3 night stay. 

Also, I've heard Hoi An isn't the greatest anymore, but it was cheaper than Hue and we are staying at  An Bang beach, so have semi high hopes!

"I have creeped on this page for a while now. And used some of the information to plan my trip. So, I thought I would post about my trip.

I just finished a 18 day trip to Vietnam and wanted to say what a great time I had. The people, the food and the landscapes were truly stunning. If you are reading this, and are thinking of visiting, I would recommend it. Its a beautiful country full of contrast. Chaotic and vibrant cities mixed with lush picturesque rural landscapes. 

highlights:

Safe

People- extremely nice, helpful.

Food and Food tour ( recommend doing this within your first day or two)

Walking tour put on by the students.    

Ha Giang loop 

Ninh Binh

Negative experience:

Ha Long bay ( IMHO, extremely overrated. dirty. Definitely not worth an 2D1N. Day trip from Hanoi if you feel you want to go. If you're short on time, skip it) 

Saigon Shuffle- Watch out for this. I took a metered taxi. when I paid, 200K VD, he switched it with a 10k bill. and said I didn't give enough. Confused. So, I gave him 100k. and he tried it again but I caught him. He returned my money after I got vocal and mad. But be aware of this...TBH, just use the Grab app ( Uber). 

Price Change Scam- I had a massage with an agreed upon discounted price. When I went to pay, they tried to make me pay full price. I paid the agreed upon price and walked out.

One of the tour operators was saying Vietnam does not get many repeat visitors and that they would like to see Vietnam resemble Thailand in this regard. I can honestly say, I will be back.  Vietnam is an easy 8.5/10 from me.....Amazing! Thank you for having me

"When did Steam use anything in Vietnam?

The only thing that needs Vietnam is VTC pay and Online Banking and it's already having 10% VAT. What else do you want?

So you mean when you buy game with Visa, you should pay tax too?

So you're saying that Steam should pay tax for operating in their country? The data is from oversea. When you buy it, it goes from oversea...to oversea. The only thing they did is allowing you buy shit from your own country too (with 10% VAT btw) + the right to access. Technically you don't even own these things, unlike GoG.  
Is Vietnam gonna block like 99% internet just from accessing? Because Vietnamese can still access them and they would not give a shit about tax in Vietnam?

Edit: Oh man these people just can't understand that Steam didn't sell shit to you people specifically. They allow you to buy it, but it's okay for you to not buy it because they don't give a fuck about you. The only ""business"" they do in Vietnam is working VTC to assist people to buy games that they sell from oversea. They didn't even arrive to you because there's nothing in Vietnam. They arrive to your account. The products are still 100% from oversea, not Vietnam. 

Edit 2: So it seems like I was wrong. Apparently consumption tax is a thing and most people other than this guy don't know what tf they were even talking about, so they keep trying to convince me that Steam had to pay for ""buying game"".

The always informative [Vietnam Weekly Newsletter](https://vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/the-billionaire-fixation) went into it briefly today  


""**We Love Billionaires**

For months, I‚Äôve observed a curious obsession with billionaires among Vietnamese media, and especially¬†*VnExpress International*¬†- and this obsession goes beyond Vietnam.

https://preview.redd.it/yvksczag6w0d1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5975e2fbd33c0c4f462d8831ce35ecb5ff15ceb

There are many more examples, including from other news outlets, and the general tone is one of admiration or even aspiration. The message seems to be that these people are fascinating and possibly even good simply because they are incredibly wealthy.

I have no insight into why these articles continue to appear, but I find it genuinely strange, especially in a nominally socialist country.

Perhaps it is fitting - and even stranger - that a government decree issued last week aims for the country to ‚Äúhave at least 10 billionaires and five businesspeople who are ‚Äòmost powerful‚Äô in Asia by 2030.‚Äù

This is a bizarre goal to be set by a national government, and more billionaires don‚Äôt necessarily equate to a healthier economy.

Currently, Vietnam has six billionaires: Ph·∫°m Nh·∫≠t V∆∞·ª£ng of Vingroup, Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ph∆∞∆°ng Th·∫£o of Sovico Group (VietJet‚Äôs parent corporation), Tr·∫ßn ƒê√¨nh Long of H√≤a Ph√°t Group, H·ªì H√πng Anh of Techcombank, Nguy·ªÖn ƒêƒÉng Quang of Masan Group, and Tr·∫ßn B√° D∆∞∆°ng of Thaco Group.

There are probably more off-book billionaires - Tr∆∞∆°ng M·ªπ Lan, for example, had more wealth than those six combined if you count what she took from Saigon Commercial Bank.""

If anyone has any suggestions on some places to go to or see in those 2 days let me know! Also, if anyone has any suggestions on places to go in Hanoi as well that would be great!

I know that one week isn't enough time to see it all, but I do plan on going back in the future for more time!

"Here's the situation: the father of a couple of friends (brother and sister, European nationality, living in Europe) spent his last 20 years in Vietnam, where he got married, had a child, and later passed away. That was about 10 years ago. Obviously his older children in Europe never saw a penny, even though he was somewhat wealthy (probably a few hundred thousand dollars net worth).
Recently I've met my cousins (in Europe), and they are telling me that they have bank documents about an account in Vietnam, and apparently his wife (widow)  couldn't access this account (everything else was officially owned by her anyway), so now  they hope they'll be able to inherit the money in this account.

How realistic is this? I see the following problems: Even if they present all the necessary documents (like the death certificate of their father, papers proving that he was their father), is there a chance that a bank will grant them access to this account? Especially given that there are other potential heirs? Btw how do you prove that there are no other rightful heirs, if there's no will?

But let's say that they find a good lawyer and somehow manage to retrieve that money, it will certainly be Vietnamese Dong, right? Or could he have had an account in a foreign currency, eg is that even possible in VN? 

But just to think it through, let's say that it's Euros or US$ (or they find a good  way to convert the Dong into that), how would they go about bringing that money home? Can you carry 10'000 US$ (or equivalent) over the border, as in most countries? And could you do this trip a number of times, and would that be legal? Or what other legal way is there to export your money?

Thanks for any insight. I was trying to talk them out of it,  because im  afraid they'll just lose money to a lawyer and he won't be of any use. But if there's a way, I'll gladly help them ",9,0,0,9,0,76.47732781861112,1884,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Me and my gf are planning a vacation in Vietnam this fall. We're probably going to stay there for a week, and then visit Laos for a couple days as well since it's nearby. Thus I've got a couple questions to people who live there or have visited earlier.   
To start of, what would be the most beautiful/interesting places to visit first? Would you recommend to stay in Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi?   
Are 3\* hotels decent considering we won't be spending most of the time inside, or should we look for a more expensive hotel to stay in?   
Do people speak basic English there so we can at least undestand each other in restaraunts/hotels etc?

Is fall a good season to visit Vietnam, or is it better to come during winter or summer?

Also, I heard that Vietnam is considered one of the cheaper countries to visit, how much would it cost us to stay there for a week, without spending a lot but having a decent time?

"It's my first time traveling to Vietnam and I'm surprised that a lot of Vietnamese girls are just ...so pretty. This is coming from a fellow southeast asian guy.

A bit of single eyelids look, east asian skin, and adorable height. Their make up look so natural and nothing too colorful.

"Hi,

I am 21(F) Vietnamese-American and interested/ looking into opportunities to work/ intern in Vietnam. I have already booked my tickets for VN this summer from July-August. I visited Vietnam last year and loved it so much that I had to return this year again. However, this time, I want to make more of my trip and truly embrace the culture more from a different perspective; in this case, a professional one. 

I would say my Vietnamese skills are intermediate at best. I can speak Vietnamese fluently and understand however the only caveat is my writing and reading. My resume is comprised mostly of legal experience regarding immigration and employer (labor) laws with some minor experiences in marketing and advertisement. I am in my third year of uni studying political science with a concentration on race, ethnicity, and international relations in the US. I want to aim my internship search on international companies with an emphasis marketing, preferably remote (or hybrid in HCM). I worry that my resume may seem too pigeonholed to the Western sphere and that this may not be realistic considering my experience/ education. My biggest concern is how the application and interview process works.

My wife and I are visiting from Australia and it is her birthday this week. She has said that she would love to get a massage and facial and her hair washed with a massage!?! 

I am looking for your recommendations on the best spa / massage treatment places in the Saigon area. Would love it not to cost a fortune, but obviously be a nice experience for her.

Also, if you have anywhere that might be nice for some cocktails and dinner that would be amazing too!

I have googled some places, but I always find asking locals gives me the best/most honest feedback! So if anyone has any suggestions, I would really appreciate to hear them.

"Hey guys!

I'm currently in Hanoi on my first trip to Vietnam from India and gotta say, your country and culture are beautiful. However, there is something bothering me.

Yesterday, I took a shower in the bathroom of my hostel dorm. I, of course, washed my hair too. However, the next day (today), I saw quite a few hair strands on my pillow and around it. I understand that losing a few hair strands everyday is normal in both men and women, but I felt they were too many of them  there.

Could it be because of the water in Hanoi being bad for your hair or am I being paranoid (because maybe I'm seeing more hair strands because of the white bedsheets)? If it's the former, can I do anything about it (I mean, I can't stop washing my hair obviously but should I wash them with mineral/RO water instead)?

If any of you could help me understand what's happening, I'll be very thankful.

Thanks

I'll be thankful if I could

The Philippines and Vietnam share a common enemy. (China) But Vietnam also claims the spratly islands, which is also claimed by the Philippines. Cough cough, and China, cough.

Vietnamese and Russian relations go back to the Cold War which probably leads to Vietnam‚Äôs longest major relationship with a country. Russia and Vietnam aren‚Äôt just significantly connected militarily, but also economically. But I think the Russian invasion of Ukraine set back relations a few ways.

I‚Äôm hoping that someone will be able to help me!

We are looking to hire private airport transfers for our large group (20 passengers including adults and children plus at least 1-2 luggages/duffel bags per person) between Tan Nhat Son Airport and our accommodation in District 3. I can‚Äôt seem to find any reputable companies that offer transportation for groups that large for a decent price. While we do have family in VN, we do not want to be a bother to them by having them arrange and pay for transportation for us, however we would like similarly priced options. What I‚Äôve been told is that a 16-seat van would be approximately 1,000,000VND so my family would need at least two of those in order to fit our luggages as well. If you know of any private coach bus transfer options that would fit all of us, that would be even better!

Additionally, we did not want to rely on our family there to arrange and book for us as our group will be separating at different times throughout our three weeks there and will need to make several different reservations for additional transfers to/from. I‚Äôm hoping to make a good deal with a trustworthy company or driver(s) that can accommodate our group several times as both full groups and smaller groups. I believe it would be at least seven trips total that we would need transfers for with a different number of passengers each time, but at least three of those will be full group (20 passengers).

"Hello everyone! :)

My friends and I will be travelling to Vietnam from Hong Kong next week and were just wondering where to buy VND. 

My question is: should we buy VND here in Hong Kong from a money exchange before our flight? Or should we exchange our money at jewelry shops or other places in Vietnam?

For context, the rate an exchange shop in Hong Kong offered me is **3,174,603 VND for $1000 HKD** (*on Google it's 3,258,152 VND for $1000 HKD*)

Do you think I'll be able to get a better rate in Vietnam? Or is this rate normal? 

I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks! ",11,0,0,11,0,131.86899915805554,578,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"SHOULD I(24M) FALL FOR A HANOI TINDER/CLUB GIRL (22F)


TLDR: Fell for this girl on tinder that works in one of the biggest clubs in Hanoi (which i didn‚Äôt know initially). She was really nice and caring. She flew to Saigon on her expense for me. Got quite deep that I know her work situation and nearly met her uncle in HCMC. Still keeping in touch via Instagram. Might visit her whenever i head back to Vietnam. But I am still sceptical about if I am being gullible and being baited into something bigger. Worst case scenarios. Can I trust this to lead to something semi serious? Can I trust these girls in general?

UPDATE: She doesn‚Äôt like me playing/partying too much and advises me to relax on the tabs at bars. Moreover, prefers to just to do normal dates, even when or if I will meet her in the future. 

STORY TELLING:

I was using tinder just to be adventurous and test the Vietnam scene. With full awareness of various bar/restaurant/ scams. Travelling with a group of 9 friends (2 Vietnamese speaking). Matched with this girl - profile pictures didnt match in person. Met at a coffee spot of my choosing near where i was staying in Old Quarter. (Keep in mind im being cautious AF and paranoid the whole situation, but didn‚Äôt mind being in a simulation LOL). She was dressed a bit fancy & we conversed via translation app. She was very nice and i made her laugh through my translations. I got very surprised she started paying for me at the cafe, taxis and bought me a fan. And told me she wanted me to have a good experience of Hanoi and brought me around sightseeing. After I invited her to hang out with my friends (friends and girlfriends) to grab dinner at a place of our choosing. I then told her I researched prior and wanted to go to this specific club in Hanoi (later finding out she works here - its fate). She told me she has connections and friends to book us. Keep in mind me and my friends have been partying almost everyday in Vietnam booking vip tables and spending 10-20 million dong per night. So I didn‚Äôt really care if she or her accomplices would pocket some commission/drinks. I just wanted good vibes. Anyways it was kind of awkward to integrate her during dinner so she asked if she could bring her best friend that also works in that club. Of course, it was fine. Found it weird she was being slightly submissive (but also outgoing & bright) and always asked for my permission or approval to make sure i wasn‚Äôt displeased. She waited in our hostel lobby as me and my friends washed up and got ready to go to the club. When we went she knew some of the workers, I got more paranoid and started testing her the whole night, waiting for her to make her money and leave or provide an inflated bill by the end of night. Also let her know I am not financially well off and just enjoying a trip. But she kept reassuring me that she doesn‚Äôt want us to get mistreated or overcharged and im pretty sure she didn‚Äôt get her commission that night, as she said she is a customer that night. As well as she didn‚Äôt want to do balloons and drink too much of our drinks, but I insisted to just have fun. My friend got with her friend, so we are now double dating the whole time. Me and my friend went to her old club to kick on and I think she was showing us off to her other friends. We then got pho together, for her mainly and she paid. She then called us a taxi home and they went home. Next day which was our final day in Hanoi/Ha Long I told her we were staying for 5 days as I thought we will never see eachother again. But then I decided to just have fun, so she hanged out with us again, as we were both interested to hang out. They found out from our airbnb host that we were leaving, and both girls got really sad (her friend cried that night and my girl was just sad). I told her to fly to HCMC so we could hang out more. They came but I had to ditch her the first night to have alone time with my friends. As she surprised visited us 2 days into our HCMC trip and got sad I was not happy to see her, as I was drunk and conflicted to accomodate both my friends and feeling bad to spend time with her. Next few days I hanged out with her to go on some movie dates or lunch dates, as well as leaving her during the day or night to spend time with my friends. She was staying at her uncles place most of the time and i invited her to stay at our airbnb 2 nights. She got super attached and told me that I was very nice and caring, and she doesn‚Äôt fall in love easily and her last relationship was 2 years ago. She seems genuine after we had some deep conversations and told me that she is sad she won‚Äôt ever see me again, but we kept it mutual to see where this situation goes. She gave me a ghost account on the first day but gave me her real instagram account on the 2nd night. And she has professed her love for me on her instagram socials. I doubt she wants my green card as it doesn‚Äôt seem she wants to come to my country (Australia). She also confessed everything to me and why she lied to me in the beginning and now i know how she gets customers. Anyways I fell for her a bit and dropped my guard. And have been in contact with her ever since.

"My understanding is that Facebook and word of mouth are the two best ways to secure a long term apartment rental (at a fair, local price), is this accurate?

I retire this year, and want to secure something longer term in Saigon. I do recall seeing an ad on here some time back which would have worked. 

Budget is $1000-$1500 USD per month, quiet (no karoke), motorbike parking, serviced (or I can find someone to clean). District 5, 6 or others, but not near the hustle of BT/PNL of District 1.

I have many Viet friends in San Jose and OC, as well as Saigon, so I will ask them to assist, but thought I'd get inputs and ideas here as well.

"This is not a small problem. It's an epidemic throughout the country. It's everywhere, at all times of day. Few things are more important in life than proper sleep, rest, peace, and the ability to relax at home after a hard days work or on a weekend. 

Yet, EVERYWHERE, at all times, there are groups of people, mostly drunk, who sit around screaming the most hideous off-key noise imaginable, into massive speakers at volumes so loud that it affects hundreds, if not thousands of people nearby. Sick? Have work to do?Tired? Have a big day tomorrow? Kids trying to sleep? Too bad. And this uncivilized toxicity is considered 'culture'. Weddings, birthdays, holidays, funerals are now just another excuse to do more of it. 

Kareoke is the encapsulation of all that is wrong with Vietnamese society; inconsiderate behavior, obnoxiously loud, selfish, destructive to others, and being oblvious to how their actions affect others. Above all, its a crystal clear example of how this corrupt govenment cares nothing of doing anything for the greater good of the country.

If Covid here taught us anything, its that things can be enforced in a hurry when its seen as a priority. Yet with real quality of life issues such as kareoke or persistant littering, nobody seems to care. It's downright shameful. I feel bad for people who will be stuck here forever and will be tormented their entire lives. I don't see it gettin better or changing.

Hi, my friends and I are travelling to Vietnam soon for the first time and I'm super duper excited because I've heard great things about the culinary. So, I just want to make this trip as perfect as possible (culinary-wise) because I'm also the person in charge of the culinary itinerary. My goal is to taste the authentic Vietnamese dishes, drinks & desserts, especially the signature dishes from Hanoi. Most items on the culinary list aim for the dishes not the restaurant, so if you have any other recommendations on which restaurant to go, or any dishes we might miss, please please let me know, üòÇ

Anyway, here's the list:

**Day 1** Hanoi

* Lunch: Banh mi @ Banh Mi 25

* Dinner: Pho @ Pho Gia Truyen Bat Dan

* Breakfast: Le Gecko Cafe
* Lunch: Van Sam Restaurant (Fansipan)
* Dinner: Horse meat, black chicken @ May Quan

**Day 3** Sapa, Hanoi

* Lunch: Cafe Bao Cap Sapa
* Dinner: ??? (we reach Hanoi at around 10PM, anything you'd recommend?)

(Very clueless on anything worth trying in Sapa for culinary)

**Day 4** Ha Long Bay

* Breakfast: Hunting any aunties on bike selling street food/snacks, especially Banh da ke, Bahn tieu, Banh day dau, Banh gio, Xoi, etc (any recommendation on where to buy near Old Quarter before 7 AM?)
* Lunch: @ Ha Long Bay (any recs?)
* Dinner: Hanoi Night Market (anything we should try?)

**Day 5** Ninh Binh

* Breakfast: Hunting the aunties on bike again üòÇ
* Lunch: @ Ninh Binh (any recs?)
* Dinner: Banh cuon @ Banh Cuon Ba Hoanh
* Snack: Truffle burrate pie @ Pizza 4P's (I know this is not authentic Vietnamese, but I can't resist it when I say the picture of the pie LOL)
* Coffee: Hanoi Train Street (also very clueless on which cafe is the best spot)

**Day 6** Hanoi

* Breakfast: Bun cha & nem @ Bun Cha Huong Lien
* Coffee: Egg coffee @ Cafe Giang
* Lunch: Bun rieu @ Bun Rieu Co Hoan
* Snack: Cha ruoi @ Cua Hang Cha Ruoi Hung Thinh (LOL should we even try this though?)
* Coffee: Bourbon coffee @ Coffee LAM 34 Ta Hien (is this a good place to buy Vietnamese coffee beans as souvenirs to bring back home?)
* Coffee: Highlands Coffee (also clueless, but this is a request from a friend, any recs?)
* Dinner: Banh xeo & Banh khot @ Mr Bay Mien Tay
* Dessert: Che @ Xoi che ba thin

I would really really really appreciate if any locals or experienced tourists have any inputs on our culinary itinerary and please help me plan the best culinary experience in Hanoi for my friends. üôè Cam on!

PS. My main priority surprisingly is to try Banh da ke and I've heard it's very difficult to find, if you know any good spots that sell this particular snack around Old Quarter, preferably in the morning, please drop the location.

"It seems kinda nuts to me that of all the tips and tricks I've been made aware of before my trip to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh) one extremely glaring thing people never mentioned once and I haven't seen it on any articles either. Is that a lot of the bikes here are pretty cheap. And more expensive motorcycles in western countries have exhaust guards to prevent any injury occuring. but in Vietnam a lot of these bikes do have guards, but also a lot of them don't! And the fact I always see grab bikers dismounting from the left of their bike now (as the exhaust is on the right usually). Just goes to show that they're clearly considering it before they dismount. 

The injury hasn't ruined my trip entirely but it does mean I can't swim on my holiday now (I've been instructed not to) which I was really looking forward to. 

No one warns you about this, not in articles, not in tips video's, not before you mount the bike.

If you manage to get a burn though be careful because there are a lot of parasites in Vietnam, make sure that you wash and clean it with spring water not water from the tap,  clean it when soapy water and use a cotton swab to remove any dirt and then pat dry. You can apply petroleum jelly, to relieve pain, but it's also good to prevent any sticking that occurs, and cover with an appropriately sized plaster. (or bandaid if you're American) This plaster needs to be changed twice a day! 

So what have we learned!? Be careful dismounting motorbikes, before you mount a bike, make sure you know which side that exhaust is on and alight from the other side. No one warned you, so I am. Have a wonderful time in Vietnam it's an incredible country Ho Chi Minh is the best place I've ever been to I absolutely love it here. So don't think this is me moaning about VN cause I love it here so much. But if you want to have a good time here there are something's to avoid and burning yourself 3 days into your holiday is probably one you wanna avoid too!

I'm coming to Vietnam for 10 Days in first half of next month. I need suggestions for setting up cities/destinations to fit in 10 days 

I know 10 days is not enough for Vietnam but thats all i can get for now, could you please give suggestions which destinations will be ideal to pick for my trip.

My arrival and departure port will be Hanoi or HCMC depending on my itinerary.

"Hi, 

I visited Vietnam maybe two years ago. I loved the food and was wondering if anyone could recommend an authentic recipe for the way morning glory is prepared in Vietnam.

"Its pretty much a common meme mocking the arrogance of the French army for the cluster%@#! that is Dien Bien Phu in particular about the widespread belief in the military stationed in Indochina that there is no way for the VietMinh to bring up artillery over the top of the mountains of DBP. An assumption that would cost the battle and lead to the worst defeat any European colonial power has aver faced after World War 2. So much to the point the French are the only major empire that lost a major head-on conventional pitch battle in the style of Clausewitz against the colonized rebels during the downfall of colonialism.

But as I read more into the whole war, it becomes apparent the French weren't alone in believing that it'd be impossible to transport artillery to Dien Bien Phu. Bernard Fall mentions that Americans who were involved in French affairs actually believed the uphill mountains would be extremely difficult even for the US army to transport any equipment with noteworthy firepower like AA guns and tanks never mind large tall heavy cannons that made up the bulk of Vietnamese far ranged weapons in the battle. At least one American intel officer ultimately agreed with the French conclusion that there's no way the stationed division there could lose as the VietMinh wouldn't have the weapons to obliterate the flimsy trenches and bunkers built on the location esp with French counter-battery. And even if they brought big guns, American analysts sincerely believed no way would they be brought in large enough numbrs with enough shells to pose a threat.

I seen British statements to the French also saying that while they warned the place would be a death trap if a Western equipped army is able to cross over, the artillery equipment would be a gigantic pain to bring up. Even the Soviets were treating the whole thing as a side show where if the VietMinh lost, its no big deal and a minor liability and if they win, well great investment for the communist PR withe little money thrown which is why the bulk of equipment came through Chinese direct aid rather than Soviets directly doing the supply chains. Basically plenty of the goods where Chinese-purchased if not even made in China and the Soviets while hoping for a victory, where not throwing big investments because  they thought it'd more likely be another typical defeat in the war.

I have to ask why did the West practically believe that the VietMinh would unlikely to have transport mass artillery into Dien Bien Phu? I mean I'm just flabbergasted reading from not just Bernard Fall but from other books of how its not just the French but the Americans equally believed as well that artillery (or at least enough of it) would be impossible to transport across the hills over the summit of the highest mountains into the valley and the Brits and Soviet pessimism in the situation for the Vietnamese side. Why was this believe so rife among first world nations? instead DBP would be the greatest single victory in a traditional Western style mass battle ever won by the anti-colonialist revolutionaries and this is due to the fact they did the impossible task of transporting howitzers and other heavy firepower into the place despite large hills and even a mountain or two alone the way!",49,0,0,46,0,190.00680394583333,3275,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I'm Tommy. Recently I was in Vietnam and had a really good time. 

I was married to someone as a semi-arranged marriage. When we tried to get our Marriage Certificate, the Vietnamese Government denied us because the City that she lives in was incorrectly listed on my ""Single"" paperwork.  

Since then, I have returned to America, but I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I really want to bring her to America as quickly as possible, but I don't know what to do.

"Good morning!

I'm looking for a music video where it was a love song ballad (I think it was created this year).

"I'm hoping it was a scam otherwise I'd feel really bad. Apologies for the long story...... 


Basically I'm cycling from Hanoi to HCM. Today I was cycling along Highway 1 about 15km outside of Ngha Trang. A guy, about 50 on an old battered scooter rode next to me and asked a few questions in Vietnamese, which I don't speak, but we managed to have a simple conversation. He then mimed that he would push me using his foot which I thought was great as it was hot and there was a decent hill coming up. . Again, I've had this before. 

After a few km I mimed I was turning along a coastal road and he said he would come with me since both routes ended at Ngha Trang, which is true. At one point he stopped for petrol and I offered to pay 20,O00 but he refused. 

We stopped for various photos and when we got to the outskirts of NT he suggested we get a drink. So we stopped for a local sugar cane Cafe. He offered to pay and pulled out his wallet taking out a 500,000 note which was strange, but I said no no and paid 20,000 for the drinks. 

We the left, again him pushing me all the way and we stopped at the NT waterfront, I said thanks for the long push, at least 15km.and said goodbye. 

This is when it gets possibly scammy. About 5 minutes later he came back all flustered saying he had lost his wallet with his cash, credit card and ID card. He did seem really upset. He said he went back to the drink place but it wasnt there. Since I had seen his 500,000 note, I gave him that as compensation since he'd been pushing me for so long. He kept asking for my number so he could pay me back but I said don't worry and he then went on his way. So was it a scam? 

Red flags
- why try and pay with a 500k note if not to show me he has it
- conveniently lost his wallet. Too coincidental 

Green flags
- He ""found""me cycling highway 1 in the middle of nowhere with no tourists. Not a good place to look for gullible tourists 
- He spent along time pushing me with his bike  and refused the cash for petrol, although maybe be waa playing the long game
- He honestly seemed upset and seemed like a genuinely nice guy. 

Personally I'm hoping it was a scam as  I'm only down USD20 and got a long push on a hot day. Alternatively the thought of him losing his wallet pushing me makes me feel really bad. 

So reddit, scam or not?

We booked a Grab car from our hotel to Marble Mountains. The driver kept trying to talk to us through a translator app. He tried to tell us about other locations to visit. He was very insistent he be our personal driver for the day. We asked how much and he said just the initial Grab price. 
I started to feel like it may be a scam at that point. But I have been to Thailand before where the red truck driver drove us around for a day. It wasn‚Äôt a crazy amount of money. The same thing happened to my fianc√© in Colombia, and it wasn‚Äôt a scam.
Instead of taking us to Marble Mountains, he took us to a sculpture store. There were a lot of other Grab cars parked there. Inside were a number of tourists. 
We were shown around the store and were pressured to buy something. The employee told us it was $55 USD for a small jade figure. 
It then really started to feel like a scam. 
I told my fianc√© to have the driver take us to Marble Mountain and pay him. 
Once there, the driver didn‚Äôt want us to pay. He kept saying he‚Äôll wait for us. 
We paid him anyway. 
Once outside, a number of shop owners jumped on us, trying to sell us the same Jade figures. 
Inside Marble Mountains, we were fine. 
But back outside, the driver came back to us and said he would wait for us in the coffee shop. He still wanted to drive us around. 
We managed to escape all the people trying to sell us stuff by going to a resort. From there, we ordered a different Grab back to our hotel.

"Me and my friend recently travelled on Vietjet to Vietnam for a holiday. Took their flights for domestic commutes as well international. 

I had a minor accident in Vietnam because of which I had to use the wheelchair. Had a fracture on my foot and hand. Here's why I am left disappointed:

1. They delayed their domestic flight thrice because of which we couldn't return home on the flight initially booked to return home.This was a connecting flight under the same PNR. They assured us we'll be let in on priority and that we'll reach on time to catch the connecting flight home at 19:45. Things were different the minute we reached HCM. They denied us from boarding. We then fought for a compensation and the next flight was 2 days after. I just had to endure this pain because of a mishap on their end. I was actually scheduled for an appointment with a doctor at home on the day of  arrival as booked initially.


2. Airports at Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh aren't very disabled friendly. We booked for assistance especially for our flight back home, right infront of them. Specifically asked them to put it in the tickets that I can't walk and need a ramp. This was done 48h prior the flight. The day we had to catch the flight, they acted surprised and made us wait another hour to make modifications to the ticket as they forgot to add the most necessary detail 'that I needed assistance to ramp'. 


3. I was boarded last on flight. 
It's a rule that airlines board disabled passengers first. But yeah they delayed making the arrangements as mentioned in point 2, simply because they forgot to put in that detail.


4. Not enough ground staff for wheel chair assistance. There was this one guy pushing two wheelchairs in high speed. Who trains these people?


Me and friend had to go through so much stress and anxiety everytime with this airlines. We almost thought we wouldn't make it home the second time, coz of all the delays and mishaps on their end. Only exception was the staff at Danang who were comparatively humane.üòÖ

I'm going to try my best to avoid this flight in the future. Not at all suitable if you are traveling with your disabled, aged family members or friends.",75,0,0,72,0,205.52606218944447,2184,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"Hi! Hope you are all doing well! 

My dad is turning 60 next month. However, on the day of his birthday, I won‚Äôt be home because I have a school field trip and it ends on the day of his birthday, which will make me come back very late. This trip was planned out since last year and was concretized 7 months ago but I only realized few days ago that it overlaps my dad‚Äôs birthday. 

I didn‚Äôt expect it to be an issue because birthday at home was never a big thing. My birthday was almost never celebrated really and at some years, it was forgotten but I didn‚Äôt make a fuss out of it. It sadden me, but I simply accept it. It seems that it‚Äôs not the case for the other people at home. 

My mom is now making a fuss since the past 2 years that her birthday has to be celebrated etc.. 

My dad never really cared about his. There‚Äôs another character in this picture and it‚Äôs his sister and she‚Äôs planned a few weeks ago to make a secret birthday for my dad. She invited tons of people and all. 

I was really waiting for this school trip and really want to go. I had a very rough year with a lot of emotionally taxing events and wanted to forget about all for a few days. 

But if I go, it seems like I‚Äôll be looked down on, that my dad will be extremely mad, I would be a shame, because I‚Äôm, as a daughter is not present. That the 60th birthday of a man and the 50th birthday of a woman is the most important. 

Yes, turning 60 is once in a lifetime but like it can sound selfish but no one really cared what age I‚Äôm turning into. A trip can always be done another time. 

So I‚Äôm wondering how important is the 60th birthday in Vietnamese culture.

I am wanting to get my bfs mom flowers for Mother‚Äôs Day (they are Vietnamese) but I know some cultures can have superstitions about certain plants or colors so I wanted to ask if anyone can give me ideas of what to get and what to stay away from. My bfs parents are pretty traditional but my bf is more relaxed about traditions and superstitions so he didn‚Äôt know when I asked him. I just really want to make a good impression because his parents are great and have been so nice and welcoming to me.

"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm visiting Vietnam with some of my friends later this month, and we will be starting our trip at Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc (4 days).

Rn we only have activities planned for the first 2 days:

Day 2: VinWonders Theme Park

"Recently a male friend of mine from Vietnam had told me that one of his male roommates had slept with him together on his comforter because his roommate's AC unit was not working. This wasnt the first time he's mentioned sleeping in the same room or bed as another guy, so this time I asked him if it's normal there to do so. He told me that it's quite normal in Vietnam starting from a young age with same-aged friends. He then said that as you grow up because of the drinking culture, which he called nh·∫≠u, it's also common for people of the same sex to sleep together with whoever lives the closest when it's very late at night. He said many people are comfortable sharing their bed with friends. I wanted to know if this is true, thanks! 

Edit: Didnt expect this post to gain so much traction! Truly appreciate everyone who took the time to share their stories. I do realize that westerners tend to sexualize normal things, and being raised Catholic (I am agnostic now) certainly ingrained some of that in me. I didn't even consider that I could possibly be sexualizing the idea of sleeping with another person, and I couldn't really put my finger on why the idea of it sounded foreign to me until I read some of the comments. Some of the comments assume that I think two men sleeping together is gay, I don't, and that's not why I was asking. I was moreso used to the idea that sleeping with someone else (especially if not family) should be avoided and that sleeping together is mainly reserved for couples, because that's how me and the people around me were raised. I did sleep with my male cousins when I was little, however as an adult my family tries to get everyone their own sleeping space. Gaining this kind of perspective has been pretty enlightening. I plan on visiting Vietnam in the near future, so I'll be sticking around this subreddit. Thanks again! ",243,0,0,210,0,234.1210741536111,1872,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"My wife and I were walking around the Old Quarter in Hanoi. We didn't have an agenda, we just wanted to explore and go off the beaten path. 

We wandered down a street and saw an open market so decided to check it out. When we got to the end of the market, we could either turn around and walk back the way we came or make another turn into what looked like a less busy alley. We decided, why not, let's go check out what's down the alley. 

Well, we soon discovered that the alley was the market area for locals to buy their meat. We saw live chickens, ducks, and other animals available for purchase. 

We were delighted to have seen a slice of life of the locals and were fascinated by a scene that isn't common at all where we live.

So here's my question: one of the vendors was selling poultry. He was taking chickens out of the baskets and opening their mouths to pour a liquid into their throat. The liquid appeared to be dark in color but neither of us could speak Vietnamese so we didn't ask what the liquid was. We did notice that the birds he had already given the liquid were a lot less excited, they seemed to be mellow and relaxed. 

Anyone know what the liquid was? No judgement at all, we're just curious what it was.

The negativity and pessimism are when they call the countey smt like lawless, no future, doomed, heading for the worst, etc... without a proper constructive criticism.

Travelling to Long Khanh from Australia next month.

Trying to decide how to get from Tan Son Nhat International Airport to Long Khanh, about 90 minute drive. We will be landing at about 6:30am on a Monday morning so I‚Äôm guessing that going through peak hour traffic will mean a longer trip.

I‚Äôm trying to estimate costs on this in order to decide what option is best.

My wife‚Äôs family can hire a 7 seater car with driver to go from Long Khanh to the airport to pick us up and take us back to Long Khanh. About 1.4 million dong or $85 AU. Her brother will come in the car from Long Khanh with the driver to greet us.

Is this a standard enough price for a private airport transfer of that distance? Happy to take recommendations of private drivers that offer this service from the airport to Long Khanh.

Firstly, does anyone have recommendations on what our split should be? More time in Hoi An or more time in Da Nang? We both want a beach vibe for a bit and also restaurants and will also throw in a temple or two. We are thinking 3 nights in Hoi An the 4 in Da Nang.

See De Mer

"Many AAA and AA studios outsource their art to Vietnamese studios like Glassegg or Thundercloud (there were and are more). The artists dont get paid enough to actually buy the game at full price, but with steam regional pricing, they might have a chance. Now that Steam is blocked, many of them lose the chance to enjoy their own work. 

The indie scene in Vietnam was already weak, the cost of game dev is high and the return on invesestment uncertain. The only advantage we had is low cost of living, making it easier to make a profit if we release our game globally. Now thats taken away too.

"I recently returned from a vacation in vietnam and I got myself a phin and different vietnamese coffee from some local roasters. I wanted to experiment with the phin to make a coffee similar to the ones I got in caf√©s so I got some questions about the process. For now I add about 2-3 tablespoons of freshly grinded beans to the phin and firstly make it wet with a bit of hot water. After like half a minute I fill the phin with water and just wait. After it dripped through the filter I add some more water because the filter is very small and I like to have a bit more coffee. I just add a bit of milk. 

Here is my question is it okay to to two pour overs? Sometimes the filter inside gets loose and the some of the grinded coffee floats to the water surface because there is no screw to fix the filter. Is this a problem or doesn't matter? I just feel a bit unsure even after watching some tutorials online so I thought I may ask here. ",9,0,0,9,0,265.08920679305555,940,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I didn't expect the country to be that developed. The internet shows 98% of people are educated. 98% are employed. That's more than America. I didn't expect the country to develop that much in just 50 years. The building were beautiful and the infrastructure was well developed.


Me and my friend had a weird run in. A guy in a bike invited us to a spa. I thought it was innocent, because we were in front of St. Joseph's Church in Hanoi. On contrary, my friend thought he wasn't inviting us just for massage. Which one of us is right. But there was indeed a spa nearby that invited us by saying they had beautiful girls.

Due to recent changes in the way citizenship card types, the latest one is called 'CƒÉn c∆∞·ªõc"" and what I have is ""ch·ª©ng minh nh√¢n d√¢n"" (CMND). By laws, all CMND will be expired at the end of this year.

I do not live in Vietnam, but I might visit, but I am not sure when will be the next time I visit VN.

"In preparation for my upcoming vacation in Vietnam I've read Christopher Goscha's book Vietnam: a new history to get a good overview of the general history of the country. From Goscha's book I get the sense that bad blood between Vietnam and China resulted mainly from the communist blocs inner crisis, sino-soviet split and realist geopolitic calculations at the time.

Then on the other hand it seems that for most of their histories Vietnam and China have had fruitful cooperation and somewhat similar political goals, shared systems of governance etc. In light of all this I've been wondering why Vietnamese feel so negatively about China?

"Just got back from 10 days in Vietnam (6 in Hanoi and 4 in Hoi-An) and wanted to answer my own questions from my April 13 post in the hopes of being able to help other travelers like us üôÇ

Original question:

Hello. We are flying to Hanoi on April 22, but will go to Hoi An to meet up with friends on April 24-27. After that, we will be back in Hanoi from April 27-May 2.

Asking for tips for the following:

1. Is it better to book a sleeper BUS or sleeper TRAIN the evening of April 23 to go from Hanoi to Hoi An?
We know flying is more convenient and saves us time but we are really interested in taking the bus or train üôÇ

-We went with a sleeper train and it was bearable for us. Not the best experience (people having video calls on their phones in speaker mode, people putting their feet up on other people‚Äôs seats, people smoking in undesignated areas) but we came well-prepared with snacks, water, sanitizing wipes, pillows, ear plugs, eye masks, blankets (the train lends you one but we brought our own), pre-downloaded shows and movies. Wifi also never got bad except when we would go under tunnels for a few seconds. The mountainside views were beautiful. If you have the luxury of time, taking the train would be okay üôÇ

2. We have 5 days in Hanoi. Should we consider visiting Sapa? If yes, what is the best way to travel there? 

We weren‚Äôt able to visit Sapa but instead booked food tours, shows, and visited multiple museums in Hanoi üôÇ

3. Top 5 places to visit in Hanoi
v touristy but fun

-For the best souvenir we found a streetside gallery on Hang Bong Street near Net Hue. The v talented artist Be paints custom shirts and canvass bags. We had our cat painted on 2 shirts and loved it!!  @be_pham_artist on Instagram. 

-cafe hopping in Old Quarter
-shopping in Old Quarter (i lived all the textile garments)
-train street was an experience
-Ho Chi Minh mausoleum was iconic
-Hoa Lo Prison
-Museum of Ethnology (loved it here)
-food tour with Ella (@ella_foodtour) on Instagram

4. Top 5 restaurants to eat at in Hanoi

We tried a number of Michelin-rated restaurants, and some local favourites.
Would recommend doing the food tour with Ella

5. Top 5 places to visit / things to do in Hoi-An

WE LOVED HOI-AN and are already planning on booking a flight from Manila-Da Nang in November so we can come back when it‚Äôs cooler

-get tailored clothes!! We had around 15 articles of clothing made and only took them 2 fittings and 1.5 days. We went with Thanh Tailors and Bong Tailors
-explore Old Town in the daytime and at night
-dive into their coffee culture (we liked Slo Cafe the most but I‚Äôm pretty sure we havent tried all the good ones yet)
-watch the Hoi An memories show
-enjoy Old Town night life

6. Top 5 restaurants to eat at in Hoi-An
-Morning Glory
-Dua CocoPlus
-i didnt get the name but the restuarant where the lady owner met Gerard Butler it dhould come up on Google üòÖ
-Bahn Mi Phuong (anthony bourdain‚Äôs fave)
-Mot for refreshments
-Mezcal bar was amazing

7. Recommended means of transport in Hanoi

-too scared to rent a motorbike. We went with Grab all the way which was cheap and reliable. We would get booked in seconds. If it‚Äôs less than 5km, we would walk.

8. Recommended means of transport in Hoi-An
-we rented a scooter / motorbike and we‚Äôd recommend it as well. Driving in hoi-an is safer and more relaxed compared to the bigger cities. Roads are also easy to navigate and my boyfriend didn‚Äôt need Google Maps by our 3rd day

9. Hotel / AirBnb recommendations in Hanoi (5 days if ever we won‚Äôt go to Sapa)

-we just went with apartments that came with a washer and dryer lol. But in Hoi An, wed highly recommend Quang Vinh Apartments and Hotel. 

10. Most convenient payment method: cash / card / online payment?
-CASH IS KING

11. Best place to get clothes made in Hanoi (good quality and fair pricing please). Or is it better to have clothes made in Hoi-An?
-we went with Thanh Tailors and Bong Tailors in Hoi-An

12. What are the best packaged / bottled Vietnamese dips / sauces can we only buy in Vietnam and bring back home? üôÇ

-fish sauce and their spicy green sauce that everyone loves.

**we were there during the start of summer and some days the heat was almost unbearable. Load up on SPF, wear light clothing, stay hydrated, and bring fans üôÇ

**more than the restuarants, we enjoyed eating at local streetside food joints more. The more locals, the better. The smaller the tables and chairs, the better. üôÇ We came prepared with medicine and rehydration salts in case we get upset stomachs but we never had a problem with any of the food we ate üôÇ

"Hello!

I was curious on peoples opinions on living in either Da Lat or Sa Pa for a few months, which might be better or which people generally prefer/think would be good for an extended stay? 

Me and my partner are thinking of staying a while longer in Vietnam to enjoy living slowly and working on our portfolios/work before returning to the UK, living on the money we have saved for 3 months. 

We loved Da Lat, the mountain ranges and the short distance to Nha Trang too. SaPa is absolutely beautiful but more landlocked, though very peaceful and quiet (perfect to focus on work). 

Which would you choose?? Both seem like great places either way! Hoi An is a possibility too but the cooler climate in the hills I think is a big bonus. ",8,0,0,8,0,278.3638331544445,741,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Few days before I solo travel in Hanoi, I haven't resolved any of this yet and still trying to figure out. The online web results are not much helpful.

1. Is there an office somewhere in Old Quarter where I can reserve bus ticket going to Sapa? Would you recommend some reliable agency please?

I prefer NOT the sleeper one. I found Sao Viet offering the seat I'm looking for but I am not comfortable to pay with my card on the website.

2. Please recommend and drop contact if you have for the Ninh Binh tours. My chats led to nothing to some that I inquired. Preferrably a small group tour where I can join as solo. Last resort is Klook for me.

I'm a teacher who takes it seriously, has a background in education, and has credentials to teach. It's good to enjoy life and let loose every once and awhile. Vietnam has many wonderful experiences, but at the end of the day people should be qualified. At the very least actually enjoy teaching.

"Hi everyone! My friend and I are co-founders of a startup and we're considering Vietnam as our base in Asia. We are specifically looking for a small, abandoned factory or storage facility, approximately 200 square meters in size. We have a budget of up to $30,000.

We're both currently based in Europe‚ÄîI'm 19 and my partner is 21. We're aiming to secure this facility by the first quarter of 2025. Given our situation, we're trying to figure out the best approach to find such a property.

Would you recommend using specific Vietnamese real estate websites or local agents? Or is it more practical to book an Airbnb for a month, come to Vietnam, and look for deals in person? Additionally, what are the typical legal procedures and expenses involved in purchasing a property like this in Vietnam?

"Heavy rain on the afternoon of May 7 caused a number of roads in Thu Duc City (Ho Chi Minh City) to be deeply flooded, the water in the sewers overflowed black, giving off a strong stench, making passersby shiver.  
This afternoon (May 7), in Ho Chi Minh City, there continues to be widespread early season rain such as Thu Duc City, District 12, Go Vap District, Tan Binh District, Tan Phu...

Recorded in Thu Duc City, around 2:00 p.m., the sky turned dark clouds covered and then quite heavy rain appeared in many areas.

Some roads were locally flooded after heavy rain lasting more than 30 minutes, such as Le Van Viet and Man Thien streets (the area bordering Hiep Phu and Tang Nhon Phu B wards), Nguyen Xien street (Long Thanh My ward). )...

Some roads were flooded with deep water, causing cars to stall. Besides, the flooded water was pitch black and had a strong stench, making people shudder.

After a record heat wave lasting many months, for about a week now, many areas in Ho Chi Minh City have had the first rains of the season. The heavy rain lasted for more than 1 hour on May 5 in Binh Chanh district, District 12, Binh Tan... causing Quach Dieu street (Binh Chanh district) to be flooded for about 500m.

Previously, on May 4, many districts in Ho Chi Minh City such as District 3, Binh Thanh, District 1... also received showers, lasting about 30 minutes. Although these rains are not too heavy, they have helped to alleviate some of the sweltering and oppressive heat caused by the intense heat over the past few months, bringing a cool and pleasant atmosphere to people.

"Hi,

Since there are always questions on this topic, here's my experience in Vietnam.

I arrived in Ho Chi Minh City and the airport is full of stands selling 3G/4G cards.

Since I've previously searched for the best providers I went directly to the official Viettel stand: here you can buy cards but they don't have e-sims and if in case you have an iPhone and need to keep your current number, e-sims are the only solution.

I went to the city and searched for a Viettel store, they first gave me prices for data with calls and SMSs, say that you only want ""data only"" plans. The prices in the city are lower, less \~$2/3 than in the airport. They will keep a photo of your passport and associate it with the card.

I found that this last part is important since 2 people from my group had problems with the data cards during our trip: one had a card purchased at Mobiphone store, she went back to a store and they were able to put it back to work. The other was purchased on a stand in the airport from the resellers. These guys are just resellers and they don't keep your information, so this card stopped working on the 1st of May and since there's no ticket or invoice her solution was to get a new one.

"So yea, if no one has known about it yet. Steam got DNS block in Vietnam. Though I can't exactly tell you why and how. But a comment from a very insightful user called u/Ancient_Wait_8788 can shead some light and insight into this matter on why this is happening.

>Sounds like Steam also isn't paying their fair share of tax, despite the Government asking them to charge VAT for several years and Steam / Valve being happy to do it elsewhere.

>Regarding the Vietnamese developers complaining about the unfair applicability of censoring between local and international... This is a genuine concern, but realistically, the law needs updating to be less strict, Vietnamese youth are already exposed to blood and gore on a pretty regular basis.

>Steam has some options to handle this:

>1. Complying with the tax requirements, having a local company, and enforcing (reasonably) the censorship requirements

>2. Completely banning Vietnamese developers from publishing on Steam in retaliation to this ban (which is likely going to be much worse than the Vietnam Government ban on Steam, at least in the short-term)

>3. Doing nothing for awhile and seeing how public discord handles the matter.

>Besides, this is likely just a DNS block which is easily circumvented, unless there is a block on the payment processor that Steam uses, I doubt this is any more than a minor speed bump.

>Having said all of this, Steam should be paying the Vietnam VAT, it's pretty reasonable and not difficult for them.

>Just to add to this, according to one of the articles about this, Steam only has 0.3% of it's user base / transactions coming from Vietnam... If considering based on the population, then it should be more like 1.25%.  

>Steam really might just not care, especially given that software/ game privacy is still rampant here and that micro transactions for MMOs are still the dominant game genre and revenue maker for PC - something which isn't a strong point for Steam / Valve.

>If they did care, they could probably work with the US Government, exploring legal options through Free Trade Agreements, Diplomatic Pressure etc, but realistically I doubt they will.

So tldr: It's mostly because Steam as a publisher/retailer is not paying taxes properly and enforcing VAT on the users like other countries. 

I do believe this is the case like the user said since the Vietnamese gov normally don't do stuffs like this unless the companies arent paying the taxes properly. In this case, I agree this is entirely Steam's fault for not complying to the laws. When purchasing some games on Steam, I did notice that some didnt charge VAT while some did so this re-enforces the point. 

To steam, it's probably not worth it to them since Vietnam is such a small market they feel like they dont have to comply to the country's laws. But with the recent upsurge of Steam usage in Vietnam, the gov cant let it slide so they decided to take actions against Steam. I think this is a wake up call from the government to steam, a warning saying that they have to comply to laws now and not avoid it.

So what do you guys think of this matter? ",25,0,0,25,0,293.1776581627778,3129,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
