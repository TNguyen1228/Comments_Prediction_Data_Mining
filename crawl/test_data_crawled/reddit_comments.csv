"Apologies for the bad quality. Google images was no help. 

Hanoi, Vietnam at a 5-star hotel. The receptionist said they were harmless baby flies that had gotten in due to the rain lately. I got switched to another room but this room also has some. I don‚Äôt mind a couple of bugs, but this many makes me paranoid they‚Äôll crawl in my ear while I sleep. They‚Äôre mainly on the textured wall by the bed and a few on the counters. Nothing in the mattress or even on the curtains by the window. I just wanna know what my roommates are. ",1,1,0,1,1,0.5127282280555556,529,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"I'll be visiting the beautiful land of the ascending dragon in about a weeks' time and traveling to Ha Giang at the start of June, where I'll commence the Ha Giang Loop ride.

I see a lot of posts here about travellers with little to no riding experience, but no posts about people who have riding experience wanting to utilise a 'bigger' bike (>500cc). I've searched every Google result - all the links are purple now and I've yet to find a motorcycle that fits the bill. Does anyone have any recommendations on a local company?

I was able to find one company with a Royal Enfield Himalayan and BMW R 1300 GS (a bit of an overkill, I know), which is right up my alley. But they're based in Hanoi and delivering the bike up to Ha Giang is US$100 each way, AND they require a IDP 1968 permit (my country only issues the IDP 1949 permit) - so that's another issue that I'm currently facing...

"Please note if my following questions are too loaded or too technical.

Some context: I've taken a recent interest in photogrammetry and would like to scan some Lego bricks I've bought. Since Lego bricks' natural gloss interfere with 3D scanning, I've done research online on materials and where to buy them. However, it seems like most vendors these materials, such as spray-on-mask, are selling to established businesses and companies instead of hobbyists like me. Besides that, there doesn't seem to be an active 3D scanning hobbyist scene from my research.

So I want to ask:

1. Are there any 3D scanning/photogrammetry vendors for hobbyists in Vietnam?
2. If there are, do they have a store in or at least ship to HCMC?
3. If there aren't, then where can I buy washable masking sprays or at least find a substitute material? It must be a material that I could apply and wash off without damage to the scanning subject.
4. Are there any forums or groups of Vietnamese 3D scanning/photogrammetry hobbyists?",0,0,0,0,0,2.6803935366666667,1010,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"So, just wanted to share this wholesome account that happened today. I'm from India and have been travelling Vietnam these days. Today I took a city tour of Hue where there was also an elderly Vietnamese couple in our group. Throughout the ride, they were very nice to me (the grandpa spoke English but the granny didn't, but she was also very smiley). They bought me beer (I hadn't asked) and explained that it was Hue's special beer (like Hanoi beer in Hanoi and Saigon beer in HCMC). They didn't even let me pay for it. Not only that, they kept giving me different food items to try, and were very happy to see that I liked the food. They both were really lovely.

In both Hanoi and Hue, people have been really nice to me, and this particular incident very much makes it clear that Vietnamese hospitality is just amazing.",0,0,0,0,0,4.96106576638889,825,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"The trail was a logistical network of roads that connected the North and South, passing through Laos and Cambodia. While the Vietnamese referred to it as the  *ƒê∆∞·ªùng Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n* ( Annamite Range Trail), it was US that named it as Ho Chi Minh Trail. There was a similiar trail during the First Indo China War set up by the Viet Minh. Rated as one of the greatest feats of military engineering ever, it was built during a time of intense warfare, and acted as a lifeline to the Viet Cong down South.

"Just got back from Vietnam - North to South tour over a couple of weeks around my partner's birthday. Absolutely loved the experience and would love to visit again and slow down the travel to take things in a bit more.

I have some tips for folk from my own experience. I'm from the UK - and specifically Cornwall where tourism is a mainstay of our local economy and I know what it's like to have your land flooded with tourists.

1: the pound is roughly 30000 Vietnamese dong, so divide by 3 and knock off some noughts. It's easier to knock off the last three 0s from the dong price first. Very important for weighing up the personal value of something you might buy/are being hassled to buy.

2: Security at airports is not like our biometric passport scanners in the UK - it's guys in very officious looking uniforms taking their sweet time to weigh up whether you should be let in (or out) of the country. Bear this in mind for planning follow up transport or arriving for a flight. Huge queues. It took about an hour after arriving to get through security, and an hour and a half when departing for our UK flight (important as they were shutting the doors by the time we got through security).

3 phone data - while queuing to get into the country in Ho Chi Minh, we opted to buy some local SIM cards from a stall next to the queues. They were ¬£8 each and gave us unlimited data for our 2 weeks. Ideal. Might be able to get it cheaper but convenience after 20 hours of travelling was worth it. EDIT - thanks to u/phantasizer for pointing out these stalls aren't legit. Our experiences were the sim cards worked fine but see their comment below.

4 airport transfers - take advantage of these where offered. Again, just takes the stress out of things as we found the country quite overwhelming, especially HCMC and Hanoi (overwhelming in a good way though).

5 city markets - we went to Hanoi, Cat Ba, Hoi An, Ph√∫ Quoc and Saigon and in each place there was a sizeable (Cat Ba was smaller) market advertised as a ""must see"" experience but in truth is the same place selling knock off clothes, luggage, souvenirs, food ingredients, etc. Every fourth or fifth stall is EXACTLY the same stuff. It gets boring after 10 minutes. Would advise visiting this wherever you are on your last day to buy some stuff to take home rather than lugging it around.

6 scooters - I wouldn't consider this unless you know how to ride a scooter, especially in the cities. Vietnamese traffic is an organic wonder to beyond from the safety of a taxi.

7 crossing the road - for UK folk, they drive on the other side in Vietnam. Very important to look both ways but believe the hype, pick your moment and go confidently - Vietnamese also have incredible spacial awareness to avoid you.

8 GRAB - download the app, add your card and Grab away. Again, speaking of convenience and least stress, you will quickly appreciate not walking for 20 minutes in +30¬∞ city heat and choosing to take an air conditioned taxi. For comparison, a trip that would cost about a tenner in UK costs a ¬£1. Incredible value for your wallet, comfort and time.

9 food - try everything. OK, maybe Thit Cho on Hanoi is a stretch too far for the average Brit but everything else should be experienced. Personal favourites were Hotpot (so wish we had similar in UK) and BBQ where it's in the middle of the table and you do all the grilling. You can find Pho for equivalent of about ¬£1 if you need shoestring food.

10 wine - some places sell local Dalat wine which is OK but wine is not a big deal in Vietnam and is usually at least UK price if not more. My partner found this hard as she doesn't like beer and didn't want to drink cocktails all holiday. Dalat is perfectly good plonk though - white and red.

11 Hoi An - don't believe the hype. We spent too long here (so sorry Saigon, you weren't as loved as you should have been). It can be done in a day and you've experienced it all. Reviews were lead to believe there was more to it. Nightlife was a laugh in a trashy way though if you want to do the whole Brits abroad thing.

12 Be respectful - my experience was that Vietnamese are a country of grinders who work all hours of the day. So speaking of Brits (or anyone else) abroad be respectful that not everyone you see is there for your photo opp or to help you and those in markets and hospitality are making a living, so don't waste their time. British especially are a nation of window shoppers and I'm not sure that came across too well on our travels. Try to be low key while you weave around the lives of Viet folk.

13 Learn to confidently say ""no thanks"" - politely saying ""no thanks, just looking"" and moving on is a valuable tool for getting through certain touristy areas. Engaging with folk will both give that person the wrong expectations and exhaust you in the process.

14 Google Translate - download this and use for basic enquiries. I don't think I was saying Xin Chao, Cam On or Tam Biet properly, so for anything beyond that, I have no clue. Don't assume people speak English - some are good enough to say Hello first to get past that.

15 Find a spot and just watch - find a coffee shop, relax and watch a very different people go about their lives. Things I enjoyed: how cool all the young people are; how obsessed the young folk are about selfies; care of children; karaoke round the dinner table (understand not to everyone's taste); friends enjoying a hotpot; lads fighting a crab into said hotpot; groups of friends having animated toasts after work; care of old folk; many and varied ways to use a scooter to carry people, goods, materials, flat screen TVs, dogs.

16 Beers in order of my personal taste - Saigon Red; Larue; Saigon Special; Hanoi; 333

17 Beer St in Saigon - go walk through it. I have never seen anything like it. Don't necessarily stop there but go observe it's wild, perverse nature.

18 If staying in a hotel, before you head out for the day, soak a flannel in water, put it in a glass, put the glass in the fridge. You will appreciate it when you get back from your enevitablely roasting walk around town (mad dogs and Englishman..).

19 pack for very hot weather (in May at least). I took a set of clothes for UK - these were worn to and from the airport and otherwise lived at the bottom on my bag. Otherwise, shorts, t-shirts and light shirts to keep the sun off. Even cotton t-shirts felt too much at times. My favourite items were a matched black linen shirt and shorts I bought out there. Pretty much lived out of them exclusively towards the end of the trip. Must have announced my musky presence from a great distance. Utilise the laundry services for sure.

20 ignore the rubbish - try to tune it out and adjust your hygiene expectations. This is important as in two weeks, I got blisters, bites, at anything and yet came away without food poisoning, infection or anything else. It's an eyesore at times to these soft UK eyes but don't let it ruin the trip. Hope Vietnam authorities can do more to handle that as it'll mount up the more the country is discovered. 

Sure there's more but just offloading after getting back. Hope it helps.

EDIT: More to add

21. Cash is king but card is accepted - in the UK, because of COVID, cash has definitely taken a back seat to contactless payment. I've rarely had to use cash other than to pay for things off FB marketplace. Vietnam isn't like that, despite being at least as technologically advanced as the UK in certain respects. Always have some dong on you. Few hundred thousand covers small purchases like water, Bahn Mi for the road, restorative coffee, etc. A lot of places do accept card but can come with a 3% fee. And get ready as they take the card and put it into the machine - it's not a scam (at least, I don't think it is) just how it's done. The card machine is handed to you for pin and then half the time they need a signature on the receipt. Monzo is a good bank for travelling as you get free ATM withdrawals on their side up to ¬£100 and you can instantly see the conversion of the latest transactions.

22. Ice cubes - when I got my travel vaccines, I was told to be wary of ice as much as tap water. From experience, iced coffee from most coffee shops has been fine (thankful in the heat) and cocktails with ice also fine. I'd maybe avoid the street side iced drinks and stick to modern looking bars,  coffee shops and hotels to be on the safe side.

23. Geckos - you may see geckos in hotel rooms and elsewhere. Fear not, they are harmless and like to feast on mosquitos. As with any wild animal though - and includes all the cute looking street dogs - observe from a distance. We shared our cabin in Phu Quoc with a foot long Tokay Gecko which absolutely freaked us out for an evening until the manager told us it's fine and just to leave it be and it'll keep it's distance. Definitely the coolest wild creature I saw.

24. Overnight train to Da Nang - if you want to traverse the length of the country and save some time, get the Night Train to Da Naaaang (cue: Madness). Pay the extra for your own cabin. It's relatively comfortable and the next day you can while away the morning watching the mountains and coast roll by. You get complimentary snacks, drinks and a simple breakfast as well.

25. Cat Ba Express - originally, we planned to make our own way to Cat Ba by taxi>train,>ferry>taxi. At last minute, I scrapped that off of a recommendation on here and went with a company called Cat Ba Express. For ¬£20 each, we got a return - hotel-to-hotel on an air conditioned bus and on the way back took up the option of a cable car over the water from Cat Ba to Haiphong. Well worth it, again for convenience and time.

26. Safety - prompted by u/G_saxboi comment below, while we both felt safe for the majority of the trip, do use common sense when out and about. If you need to get your bearings, find a coffee shop, have a sit down and a drink, and check then - being glued to your phone while walking around isn't the best advice in most touristy parts of the world.

Regarding Beer St in Saigon - you can walk through albeit hassled to come for a drink but enter any of those establishments at your own risk.

Also, generally good advice not to engage with anyone who randomly comes up to you. Just say ""no thanks"" and move on.",10,10,0,10,10,6.235702708055556,10319,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I just finished a 18 day trip to Vietnam and wanted to say what a great time I had. The people, the food and the landscapes were truly stunning. If you are reading this, and are thinking of visiting, I would recommend it. Its a beautiful country full of contrast. Chaotic and vibrant cities mixed with lush picturesque rural landscapes. 

highlights:

Safe

People- extremely nice, helpful.

Food and Food tour ( recommend doing this within your first day or two)

Walking tour put on by the students.    

Ha Giang loop 

Ninh Binh

Negative experience:

Ha Long bay ( IMHO, extremely overrated. dirty. Definitely not worth an 2D1N. Day trip from Hanoi if you feel you want to go. If you're short on time, skip it) 

Saigon Shuffle- Watch out for this. I took a metered taxi. when I paid, 200K VD, he switched it with a 10k bill. and said I didn't give enough. Confused. So, I gave him 100k. and he tried it again but I caught him. He returned my money after I got vocal and mad. But be aware of this...TBH, just use the Grab app ( Uber). 

Price Change Scam- I had a massage with an agreed upon discounted price. When I went to pay, they tried to make me pay full price. I paid the agreed upon price and walked out.

One of the tour operators was saying Vietnam does not get many repeat visitors and that they would like to see Vietnam resemble Thailand in this regard. I can honestly say, I will be back.  Vietnam is an easy 8.5/10 from me.....Amazing! Thank you for having me

"When did Steam use anything in Vietnam?

The only thing that needs Vietnam is VTC pay and Online Banking and it's already having 10% VAT. What else do you want?

So you mean when you buy game with Visa, you should pay tax too?

So you're saying that Steam should pay tax for operating in their country? The data is from oversea. When you buy it, it goes from oversea...to oversea. The only thing they did is allowing you buy shit from your own country too (with 10% VAT btw) + the right to access. Technically you don't even own these things, unlike GoG.  
Is Vietnam gonna block like 99% internet just from accessing? Because Vietnamese can still access them and they would not give a shit about tax in Vietnam?

Edit: Oh man these people just can't understand that Steam didn't sell shit to you people specifically. They allow you to buy it, but it's okay for you to not buy it because they don't give a fuck about you. The only ""business"" they do in Vietnam is working VTC to assist people to buy games that they sell from oversea. They didn't even arrive to you because there's nothing in Vietnam. They arrive to your account. The products are still 100% from oversea, not Vietnam. 

Edit 2: So it seems like I was wrong. Apparently consumption tax is a thing and most people other than this guy don't know what tf they were even talking about, so they keep trying to convince me that Steam had to pay for ""buying game"".

The always informative [Vietnam Weekly Newsletter](https://vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/the-billionaire-fixation) went into it briefly today  


""**We Love Billionaires**

For months, I‚Äôve observed a curious obsession with billionaires among Vietnamese media, and especially¬†*VnExpress International*¬†- and this obsession goes beyond Vietnam.

https://preview.redd.it/yvksczag6w0d1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5975e2fbd33c0c4f462d8831ce35ecb5ff15ceb

There are many more examples, including from other news outlets, and the general tone is one of admiration or even aspiration. The message seems to be that these people are fascinating and possibly even good simply because they are incredibly wealthy.

I have no insight into why these articles continue to appear, but I find it genuinely strange, especially in a nominally socialist country.

Perhaps it is fitting - and even stranger - that a government decree issued last week aims for the country to ‚Äúhave at least 10 billionaires and five businesspeople who are ‚Äòmost powerful‚Äô in Asia by 2030.‚Äù

This is a bizarre goal to be set by a national government, and more billionaires don‚Äôt necessarily equate to a healthier economy.

Currently, Vietnam has six billionaires: Ph·∫°m Nh·∫≠t V∆∞·ª£ng of Vingroup, Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ph∆∞∆°ng Th·∫£o of Sovico Group (VietJet‚Äôs parent corporation), Tr·∫ßn ƒê√¨nh Long of H√≤a Ph√°t Group, H·ªì H√πng Anh of Techcombank, Nguy·ªÖn ƒêƒÉng Quang of Masan Group, and Tr·∫ßn B√° D∆∞∆°ng of Thaco Group.

There are probably more off-book billionaires - Tr∆∞∆°ng M·ªπ Lan, for example, had more wealth than those six combined if you count what she took from Saigon Commercial Bank.""

"Here's the situation: the father of a couple of friends (brother and sister, European nationality, living in Europe) spent his last 20 years in Vietnam, where he got married, had a child, and later passed away. That was about 10 years ago. Obviously his older children in Europe never saw a penny, even though he was somewhat wealthy (probably a few hundred thousand dollars net worth).
Recently I've met my cousins (in Europe), and they are telling me that they have bank documents about an account in Vietnam, and apparently his wife (widow)  couldn't access this account (everything else was officially owned by her anyway), so now  they hope they'll be able to inherit the money in this account.

How realistic is this? I see the following problems: Even if they present all the necessary documents (like the death certificate of their father, papers proving that he was their father), is there a chance that a bank will grant them access to this account? Especially given that there are other potential heirs? Btw how do you prove that there are no other rightful heirs, if there's no will?

But let's say that they find a good lawyer and somehow manage to retrieve that money, it will certainly be Vietnamese Dong, right? Or could he have had an account in a foreign currency, eg is that even possible in VN? 

But just to think it through, let's say that it's Euros or US$ (or they find a good  way to convert the Dong into that), how would they go about bringing that money home? Can you carry 10'000 US$ (or equivalent) over the border, as in most countries? And could you do this trip a number of times, and would that be legal? Or what other legal way is there to export your money?

Thanks for any insight. I was trying to talk them out of it,  because im  afraid they'll just lose money to a lawyer and he won't be of any use. But if there's a way, I'll gladly help them ",9,0,0,9,0,72.32220384027778,1884,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Hello there!  
Me and my gf are planning a vacation in Vietnam this fall. We're probably going to stay there for a week, and then visit Laos for a couple days as well since it's nearby. Thus I've got a couple questions to people who live there or have visited earlier.   
To start of, what would be the most beautiful/interesting places to visit first? Would you recommend to stay in Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi?   
Are 3\* hotels decent considering we won't be spending most of the time inside, or should we look for a more expensive hotel to stay in?   
Do people speak basic English there so we can at least undestand each other in restaraunts/hotels etc?

Is fall a good season to visit Vietnam, or is it better to come during winter or summer?

Also, I heard that Vietnam is considered one of the cheaper countries to visit, how much would it cost us to stay there for a week, without spending a lot but having a decent time?  
Any other recomendations would be also greatly appreciated!",3,0,0,3,0,75.816794295,985,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

"It's my first time traveling to Vietnam and I'm surprised that a lot of Vietnamese girls are just ...so pretty. This is coming from a fellow southeast asian guy. I know this post might just .. silly. I think Vietnamese girls seems to have a great combination of southeast and east asian features. A bit of single eyelids look, east asian skin, and adorable height. Their make up look so natural and nothing too colorful. I'm also surprised that I see a lot of young people more than older people in Hanoi. It feel like walking in a university where it's so common to see people in their ealy 20s.

"Hi,

I am 21(F) Vietnamese-American and interested/ looking into opportunities to work/ intern in Vietnam. I have already booked my tickets for VN this summer from July-August. I visited Vietnam last year and loved it so much that I had to return this year again. However, this time, I want to make more of my trip and truly embrace the culture more from a different perspective; in this case, a professional one. 

I would say my Vietnamese skills are intermediate at best. I can speak Vietnamese fluently and understand however the only caveat is my writing and reading. My resume is comprised mostly of legal experience regarding immigration and employer (labor) laws with some minor experiences in marketing and advertisement. I am in my third year of uni studying political science with a concentration on race, ethnicity, and international relations in the US. I want to aim my internship search on international companies with an emphasis marketing, preferably remote (or hybrid in HCM). I worry that my resume may seem too pigeonholed to the Western sphere and that this may not be realistic considering my experience/ education. My biggest concern is how the application and interview process works.

I'm currently in Hanoi on my first trip to Vietnam from India and gotta say, your country and culture are beautiful. However, there is something bothering me.

Yesterday, I took a shower in the bathroom of my hostel dorm. I, of course, washed my hair too. However, the next day (today), I saw quite a few hair strands on my pillow and around it. I understand that losing a few hair strands everyday is normal in both men and women, but I felt they were too many of them  there.

Could it be because of the water in Hanoi being bad for your hair or am I being paranoid (because maybe I'm seeing more hair strands because of the white bedsheets)?

I dont really want to go to college because i dont like the education system here and im struggling with making friends because almost everyone (vietnamese that ive met so far) couldnt really relate to me.

I know that the us has a positive view of Vietnam even after the Vietnam war. Likely for common interests in security in South East Asia. But I don‚Äôt think the us would be Vietnam‚Äôs first choice.

The Philippines and Vietnam share a common enemy. (China) But Vietnam also claims the spratly islands, which is also claimed by the Philippines. Cough cough, and China, cough.

Vietnamese and Russian relations go back to the Cold War which probably leads to Vietnam‚Äôs longest major relationship with a country. Russia and Vietnam aren‚Äôt just significantly connected militarily, but also economically. But I think the Russian invasion of Ukraine set back relations a few ways.

"Hi all! First time creating my own post, so please bear with me. I am Viet Kieu and will be traveling back to VN with my very large family. I‚Äôve tried searching through the threads, Klook, GetYourGuide, Viator, and general Google searches, but can‚Äôt seem to find what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm hoping that someone will be able to help me!

We are looking to hire private airport transfers for our large group (20 passengers including adults and children plus at least 1-2 luggages/duffel bags per person) between Tan Nhat Son Airport and our accommodation in District 3. I can‚Äôt seem to find any reputable companies that offer transportation for groups that large for a decent price. While we do have family in VN, we do not want to be a bother to them by having them arrange and pay for transportation for us, however we would like similarly priced options. What I‚Äôve been told is that a 16-seat van would be approximately 1,000,000VND so my family would need at least two of those in order to fit our luggages as well. If you know of any private coach bus transfer options that would fit all of us, that would be even better!

Additionally, we did not want to rely on our family there to arrange and book for us as our group will be separating at different times throughout our three weeks there and will need to make several different reservations for additional transfers to/from. I‚Äôm hoping to make a good deal with a trustworthy company or driver(s) that can accommodate our group several times as both full groups and smaller groups. I believe it would be at least seven trips total that we would need transfers for with a different number of passengers each time, but at least three of those will be full group (20 passengers).

"SHOULD I(24M) FALL FOR A HANOI TINDER/CLUB GIRL (22F)


TLDR: Fell for this girl on tinder that works in one of the biggest clubs in Hanoi (which i didn‚Äôt know initially). She was really nice and caring. She flew to Saigon on her expense for me. Got quite deep that I know her work situation and nearly met her uncle in HCMC. Still keeping in touch via Instagram. Might visit her whenever i head back to Vietnam. But I am still sceptical about if I am being gullible and being baited into something bigger. Worst case scenarios. Can I trust this to lead to something semi serious? Can I trust these girls in general?

UPDATE: She doesn‚Äôt like me playing/partying too much and advises me to relax on the tabs at bars. Moreover, prefers to just to do normal dates, even when or if I will meet her in the future. 

STORY TELLING:

I was using tinder just to be adventurous and test the Vietnam scene. With full awareness of various bar/restaurant/ scams. Travelling with a group of 9 friends (2 Vietnamese speaking). Matched with this girl - profile pictures didnt match in person. Met at a coffee spot of my choosing near where i was staying in Old Quarter. (Keep in mind im being cautious AF and paranoid the whole situation, but didn‚Äôt mind being in a simulation LOL). She was dressed a bit fancy & we conversed via translation app. She was very nice and i made her laugh through my translations. I got very surprised she started paying for me at the cafe, taxis and bought me a fan. And told me she wanted me to have a good experience of Hanoi and brought me around sightseeing. After I invited her to hang out with my friends (friends and girlfriends) to grab dinner at a place of our choosing. I then told her I researched prior and wanted to go to this specific club in Hanoi (later finding out she works here - its fate). She told me she has connections and friends to book us. Keep in mind me and my friends have been partying almost everyday in Vietnam booking vip tables and spending 10-20 million dong per night. So I didn‚Äôt really care if she or her accomplices would pocket some commission/drinks. I just wanted good vibes. Anyways it was kind of awkward to integrate her during dinner so she asked if she could bring her best friend that also works in that club. Of course, it was fine. Found it weird she was being slightly submissive (but also outgoing & bright) and always asked for my permission or approval to make sure i wasn‚Äôt displeased. She waited in our hostel lobby as me and my friends washed up and got ready to go to the club. When we went she knew some of the workers, I got more paranoid and started testing her the whole night, waiting for her to make her money and leave or provide an inflated bill by the end of night. Also let her know I am not financially well off and just enjoying a trip. But she kept reassuring me that she doesn‚Äôt want us to get mistreated or overcharged and im pretty sure she didn‚Äôt get her commission that night, as she said she is a customer that night. As well as she didn‚Äôt want to do balloons and drink too much of our drinks, but I insisted to just have fun. My friend got with her friend, so we are now double dating the whole time. Me and my friend went to her old club to kick on and I think she was showing us off to her other friends. We then got pho together, for her mainly and she paid. She then called us a taxi home and they went home. Next day which was our final day in Hanoi/Ha Long I told her we were staying for 5 days as I thought we will never see eachother again. But then I decided to just have fun, so she hanged out with us again, as we were both interested to hang out. They found out from our airbnb host that we were leaving, and both girls got really sad (her friend cried that night and my girl was just sad). I told her to fly to HCMC so we could hang out more. They came but I had to ditch her the first night to have alone time with my friends. As she surprised visited us 2 days into our HCMC trip and got sad I was not happy to see her, as I was drunk and conflicted to accomodate both my friends and feeling bad to spend time with her. Next few days I hanged out with her to go on some movie dates or lunch dates, as well as leaving her during the day or night to spend time with my friends. She was staying at her uncles place most of the time and i invited her to stay at our airbnb 2 nights. She got super attached and told me that I was very nice and caring, and she doesn‚Äôt fall in love easily and her last relationship was 2 years ago. She seems genuine after we had some deep conversations and told me that she is sad she won‚Äôt ever see me again, but we kept it mutual to see where this situation goes. She gave me a ghost account on the first day but gave me her real instagram account on the 2nd night. And she has professed her love for me on her instagram socials. I doubt she wants my green card as it doesn‚Äôt seem she wants to come to my country (Australia). She also confessed everything to me and why she lied to me in the beginning and now i know how she gets customers. Anyways I fell for her a bit and dropped my guard. And have been in contact with her ever since.
